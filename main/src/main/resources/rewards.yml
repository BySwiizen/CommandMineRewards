# (rewardSectionName): section: put rewards in this format:
# (rewardSectionName):
#   (name):
#       blocks: string list: Name of block to trigger rewards. You can add `:true` or `:false` after the name to indicate whether the block should be fully-grown.
#               Also, you may add a `%` and a number to create a multiplier for the block. `%3` would mean it has 3x the normal chance of happening, and `%0.25` means 1/4 the normal chance.
#       rewardLimit: number: maximum amount of rewards in this section that can be issued from a single block break.
#       allowedWorlds: string list: a list of worlds this reward section will operate in.  Defaults to "*", meaning it will operate in any world.
#       allowedRegions: string list: same as allowedWorlds, but WorldGuard regions
#       silkTouch: string, can be REQUIRED, IGNORED, or DISALLOWED:  Sets whether silk touch is required, ignored, or prevented from receiving a reward in this section.  Overrides globalSilkTouch, is overriden by silkTouch in a reward under this section.  Defaults to IGNORED.
#       rewards:
#           (individualname):
#               chance: double (integer or floating point):  Chance out of 100 for the reward to be triggered.
#               commands: String list:  Command(s) to run if reward is triggered.
#               silkTouch: string, can be REQUIRED, IGNORED, OR DISALLOWED:  Sets whether a silk touch pickaxe is required, ignored, or prevented from receiving this reward.  Overrides globalSilkTouch and silkTouch in parent reward section.  Defaults to IGNORED.
#           (individualname2):
#               chance: double (integer or floating point):  Chance out of 100 for the reward to be triggered.
#               commands: String list:  Command(s) to run if reward is triggered.
#               silkTouch: string, can be REQUIRED, IGNORED, OR DISALLOWED:  Sets whether a silk touch pickaxe is required, ignored, or prevented from receiving this reward.  Overrides globalSilkTouch and silkTouch in parent reward section.  Defaults to IGNORED.
#           (etc.)
#   (end of reward section #1)
#     (add more rewards to your preference)
#
# multiplier: double (integer or floating point):  Number to multiply chance of getting reward by.
# globalRewardLimit: integer: If set greater than -1, will limit the total amount of rewards issued per block broken to that number, meaning if it's set to 0, no rewards will ever be issued.
